The project is a client - server application, constructed of a Java server and an Android app that work together. 

The server is based on Spring Boot and MySQL database. It contains a list of employees that are loaded in real time to an Android mobile device through REST APIs.

The client on the Android mobile device can read the list of employees from the server, and add in realtime employees to the database.
